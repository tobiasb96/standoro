# Standoro

A macOS menu bar application that helps you maintain good posture and productivity through intelligent reminders, motion detection, and focus sessions.

## üéØ Overview

Standoro is a comprehensive wellness and productivity app that combines:

- **Posture Monitoring**: Uses AirPods motion data to detect poor posture and provide gentle reminders
- **Stand/Desk Reminders**: Alternates between sitting and standing periods to reduce sedentary behavior

## üîß Technical Details

### Dependencies

#### System Frameworks
- **SwiftUI**: Modern UI framework

- **Combine**: Reactive programming
- **UserNotifications**: Local notification system
- **EventKit**: Calendar integration
- **CoreMotion**: Motion data access (via AirPods)

#### macOS Requirements
- **macOS 14.0+**: Required for AirPods motion data
- **Swift 5.9+**: Language version
- **Xcode 15.0+**: Development environment

### Data Models

#### UserPrefs (SwiftData Model)
```swift
@Model
class UserPrefs {
    var maxSitMinutes: Int
    var maxStandMinutes: Int
    var calendarFilter: Bool
    var postureMonitoringEnabled: Bool?
    var pomodoroModeEnabled: Bool?
    // ... additional properties
}
```

#### ActivityRecord (Statistics)
```swift
struct ActivityRecord {
    let date: Date
    let focusSeconds: TimeInterval
    let sittingSeconds: TimeInterval
    let standingSeconds: TimeInterval
    let breaksTaken: Int
    let postureAlerts: Int
}
```

### Motion Detection Architecture

The motion detection system uses a modular architecture:

1. **Motion Providers**: Abstract data sources (AirPods, iPhone, etc.)
2. **Analyzers**: Feature-specific analysis (posture, standup detection)
3. **Notification Service**: Centralized notification management
4. **Motion Service**: Main orchestrator coordinating all components

### Performance Considerations

- **Battery Optimization**: Motion detection uses efficient sampling rates
- **Memory Management**: In-memory statistics with planned persistence
- **CPU Usage**: Minimal background processing
- **Network**: No external network dependencies
