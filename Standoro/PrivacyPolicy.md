# Privacy Policy for Standoro

**Last updated:** January 2025

## Introduction

Standoro ("we," "our," or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and safeguard your information when you use our macOS application.

## Information We Collect

### Local Data Only
Standoro operates entirely on your device. We do not collect, store, or transmit any personal data to external servers.

### Data Types
- **Motion Data**: When you enable posture monitoring, Standoro accesses motion data from your AirPods to detect your sitting posture. This data is processed locally and never leaves your device.
- **Calendar Data**: If you enable calendar integration, Standoro reads your calendar events to mute notifications during meetings. This data is accessed locally and not stored or transmitted.
- **Usage Statistics**: The app tracks your activity patterns (sitting/standing times, posture alerts, etc.) locally for personal insights. This data remains on your device.

## How We Use Your Information

### Motion Data
- Detect poor posture and provide gentle reminders
- Monitor your sitting and standing patterns
- Provide real-time posture feedback

### Calendar Data
- Identify when you're in meetings or calls
- Automatically mute posture notifications during busy periods
- Respect your schedule and avoid interruptions

### Usage Statistics

## Data Storage and Security

### Local Storage
All data is stored locally on your device using:
